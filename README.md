We have chosen the topic “Music Mood Recommendation System” because it addresses a significant limitation in modern recommender systems and also because music is deeply connected to human emotions, and every individual resonates with songs differently based on their current mood or mental state. 
What excites me about this project is the opportunity to combine machine learning, NLP, and deep learning to go beyond traditional recommendation systems, which usually rely only on listening history. 
Instead, our project aims to analyze user moods from text inputs, voice tones, or even facial expressions, and then recommend songs that emotionally match the user in real time. 
This idea interests me as it merges technology with psychology, creating a more personalized and human-centered experience. 
It is innovative, as we plan to integrate multimodal emotion detection (text + audio + image) with recommendation, which can make the system smarter and different from existing models.
Most music apps suggest songs based on what you have listened to before, but they don't know how you are feeling right now. Our project aims to build a smarter system that tries to understand your current mood and then recommends a playlist or automatically play a song that perfectly matches it. 
It's all about making music discovery more personal and it tunes with your emotions.
