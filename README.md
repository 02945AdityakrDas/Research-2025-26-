We have chose this project called "Mood Based Music Recommender System" because it addresses a significant limitation in modern recommender systems.
Most music apps suggest songs based on what you have listened to before, but they don't know how you are feeling right now. Our project aims to build a smarter system that 
tries to understand your current mood and then recommends a playlist or automatically play a song that perfectly matches it. It's all about making music discovery more personal
and in tune with your emotions.
